# Collecting Twitter Data

This repository contains the handout and code examples for the workshop "Collecting Twitter Data for Research."

This workshop is the first in a two-part series on social media data. Twitter data provide researchers with a real-time view into a wide variety of social and cultural topics. In this workshop, weâ€™ll explore two tools---TAGS and rtweet---for collecting social media data from Twitter.
